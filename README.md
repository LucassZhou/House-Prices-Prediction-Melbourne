# House-Prices-Prediction-Melbourne

Predicting house prices accurately is vital in the real estate market, serving as a crucial tool for buyers and sellers alike. This project develops a machine learning-based approach to predict house prices, leveraging a dataset from Kaggle titled "House Price Prediction Australia." The methodology encompasses several key steps to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the predictions:

Data Cleaning: Initial preprocessing to cleanse the dataset of inaccuracies, missing values, and outliers, preparing it for analysis.

Feature Correlation Analysis: Employed to identify and eliminate redundant features that do not contribute additional value to the predictive model.

Feature Selection: Utilized to pinpoint the most informative features that significantly impact house prices, streamlining the model for efficiency and effectiveness.

Model Development: Deployment of various regression algorithms to model the relationship between house features and their respective prices, aiming for the highest prediction accuracy.

Through these carefully structured steps, the project aims to provide a robust model capable of predicting house prices with high precision, ultimately benefiting stakeholders in the real estate market.
